# Grant_Ross_Data_Sync_Final

This project was created to show the theoretical architecture of a data sync migrating data from a in-house enterprise database to a external CRM platform. There are two main processes one sync process and one discovery process which is responsible for moving the data. There is a mocked class for the database dependency and a mocked class for the CRM dependency. A UI has been provided that allows the user to interact and play with these operations.
